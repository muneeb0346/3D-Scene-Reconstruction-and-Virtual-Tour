# 3D-Scene-Reconstruction-and-Virtual-Tour
This is an implementation of a complete Structure from Motion (SfM) and visualization pipeline for the CS436: Computer Vision Fundamentals course. The goal is to take a collection of 2D photographs of a static scene and transform them into a sparse 3D point cloud and an interactive "virtual tour" viewer, inspired by applications like Photosynth.
